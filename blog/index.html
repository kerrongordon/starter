It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p></div></article><article class="post__article"><header class="post__header"><img src="assets/img/postImg/post-5.jpg" class="post__img"><h3 class="title post__title">survived not only five centuries</h3><span>2015-10-10 00:00:00 -0400</span></header><div class="post__content"><p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
